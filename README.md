# svm_wrappers

Created as part of my research in the USC Automatic Coordination of Teams (ACT) Lab. This library contains code that utilizes various C and C++ support vector machine libraries to solve simple SVM problems. It also provides a template problem type that supports the addition of more solvers in the future.

Currently forked by the ACT Lab and used in their robot trajectory re-planning algorithm.
